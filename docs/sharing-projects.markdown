Sharing boards and tasks
========================

By default, boards are private but it's possible to make a board public.

A public board can't be modified, it's a **read-only access**.
This access is protected by a random token, only people who have the right token can see the board.

Public boards are automatically refreshed every 60 seconds.
Task details are also available in read-only.

Usage examples:

- Share your board with someone outside of your organization
- Display the board on a large screen in your office

Enable public access
-------------------

Select your project, then click on "Public access" and finally click on the button "Enable public access".

![Enable public access](http://kanboard.net/screenshots/documentation/project-enable-sharing.png)

After that, you got the public link and the RSS feed.
The activity feed is available only when the public access is activated.

![Disable public access](http://kanboard.net/screenshots/documentation/project-disable-sharing.png)

You can also disable the public access whenever you want.
Each time, you enable or disable the public access a new random token is generated.
The old link will not work anymore.
